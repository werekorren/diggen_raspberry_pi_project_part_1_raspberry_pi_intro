\section{Introduction}
In this project part, you will get acquainted with a Raspberry Pi 4. 
In the first part you will
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Unpack your Pi
\item[2.] Install Raspberry Pi OS on your SD-card
\item[3.] Start your Pi for the first time!
\item[4.] Update, upgrade and install software on your Pi
\end{itemize}

\noindent You will need some things before starting out
\begin{itemize}
    \item A computer
    \item A SD-card reader (often built into a laptop)
    \item A TV/monitor with a HDMI-socket (or an other socket that you have an HDMI-adapter for)
    \item A USB-keyboard
    \item A USB-mouse
\end{itemize}



\section{What is a Raspberry Pi?}
A Raspberry Pi is a small computer that is built on a single circuit board. A Raspberry Pi has everything (well almost) that other computers have; a processor, memory as well as USB, ethernet, and HDMI input/output sockets. Read more about your model (Raspberry Pi 4) on {\color{blue}\href{https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/}{Raspberry Pis official website (\texttt{https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/})}}.

\end{center}

\newpage

\section{The Lab Kit}
The lab kit consists of the Raspberry Pi 4 KIT and the Raspberry Pi SENSE HAT. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=30mm]{rpi_kit_box_no_bg.png}
\includegraphics[width=20mm]{rpi_sense_hat_box_no_bg.png}
\end{center}

\section{Unboxing the Raspberry Pi}
Your Raspberry Pi 4 KIT contains not only the actual Raspberry Pi, but also a case and a power supply for your Pi, a 16GB or 32 GB SD card and an HDMI cable.

\section{Setting up the OS}
The operating system (OS) is the software that binds everything in a computer together. It connects the USB-socket with software that wants to utilise it, e.g. software for a keyboard. Generally speaking an OS connects hardware with software/applications that the user interacts with \cite{OS}. The most common OS is Microsoft Windows, but the one we are going to use is called \emph{Raspberry Pi OS}. Raspberry Pi OS (PiOS from now on) is, as the name implies, specifically developed for a Raspberry Pi. PiOS is based on \emph{Debian}, and Debian in itself has a Linux-kernel. Now - to work! 

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] You need to install the latest version of PiOS, and to do that you need a computer with an SD card reader or an adapter with an SD card reader. If you don't have one probably you have a friend who does.

\item[2.] Go to  {\color{blue}\href{https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/}{this website (\texttt{https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/})}} and download the Raspberry Pi Imager that suits your OS. Most of you are going to choose \emph{Download for Windows} since we all learned that Windows is the most common OS, but there are also versions for MacOS and Linux.

\item[3.] Install the file that was downloaded and start the Raspberry Pi Imager application.

\item[4.] Insert your SD card into your computer SD card slot.

\item[5.] Under ''Raspberry Pi Device'' choose ''RaspBerry Pi 4'', under ''Operating System'' choose ''Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)'' and finally, under ''Storage'' choose your newly inserted SD card. Then click on ''NEXT''.

\item[6.] At this point you can choose to preconfigure your new operating system. If you choose not to, click ''NO''. You will then be asked to configure the operating system when you start it for the first time. You will find instructions for how to do this below. If, on the other hand, you do decide to preconfigure the operating system do like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a) ] Click ''EDIT SETTINGS''.
\item[b) ] Give your Raspberry a name (under ''Set hostname'').
\item[c) ] Choose a username and password for your user.
\item[d) ] If you are at home and have access to a WiFi network you can configure it now. Otherwise skip the ''Configure wireless LAN'' section. We will configure access to Eduroam later -- it cannot be done here.
\item[e) ] Under ''Set locale settings'' choose ''Europe/Stockholm'' (time zone) and ''se'' (keyboard).
\item[f) ] We also recommend that you enable SSH under the ''Services'' tab -- choose ''use password authentication'' -- and deselect ''Enable telemetry'' under the ''Options'' tab.
\item[g) ] Finally click ''SAVE'' followed by ''YES''.
\end{itemize}

\item[4.] The installation might take a while \ldots

\item[5.] When the installation is done, remove your SD-card from the computer. You are ready to start your Pi!

\end{itemize}
  
\section{Starting your Pi for the first time}
Your are (almost) ready to start your Pi! You need some things before:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A TV/monitor with a HDMI-socket (or an other socket that you have an HDMI-adapter for)
    \item A USB keyboard
    \item A USB mouse
    \item A power outlet to power your Pi
\end{itemize}
Now you are ready to go!

Follow {\color{blue}\href{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3}{this guide (\texttt{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3})}} until you have reached the part where you need to restart you Pi. Restart it!

Depending on whether you preconfigured your operating system or not you will either boot into the Raspberry Pi OS desktop or into the initial setup screens. If no extra setup is required, continue to the next section, ''Setting up Eduroam''. If you, on the other hand, see the initial setup screen complete the configuration like this:

\begin{itemize}

\item[1. ] Click ''Next''.

\item[2. ] In the ''Set Country'' dialog enter:\\
Country -- Sweden\\
Language -- Swedish\\
Timezone -- Stockholm\\
Also check ''Use English language'' and finally click ''Next''.

\item[3. ] Enter the user name and password you would like to have in the ''Create User'' dialog and click ''Next''.

\item[4. ] If you are at home and have access to a WiFi network you can configure it in the next dialog and click ''Next''. If not, click ''Skip''. We will configure access to Eduroam later.

\item[5. ] Choose your desired Internet browser in the next dialog and click ''Next''.

\item[6. ] Click ''Skip'' when asked to update the software (we will do that later) and finally click ''Launch'' to finish the configuration.

\end{itemize}

\section{Connecting to Eduroam}

If you are working at home and have managed to connect to a network you can skip this section for now and return to it when you want to connect your Raspberry Pi to Eduroam.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.] Click on the network icon in the upper right corner of the screen. It will either look as a blue WiFi symbol or a symbol with two orange arrow halves crossed over in red depending on your connection status. Choose ''Turn On Wireless LAN'' if WiFi is not already enabled. 
    \item[2.] Then choose ''eduroam'' in the menu that appears.
    \item[3.] Fill out the form that appears according to Figure \ref{fig:eduroam}.
    \item[4.] Click Connect.
\end{enumerate}
Your Raspberry Pi should now connect to Eduroam and the network icon should now become blue.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=90mm]{eduroam.png}
    \caption{How to enter your credentials into the network manager}
    \label{fig:eduroam}
\end{figure}



\section{Understanding the packaging system}
The operating system (OS) you are using does not update itself, like if you are using Windows, the computer sometimes download and installs updates on its own. The Raspberry Pi OS gives you more control over your computer as to how, what and when you want to expand and upgrade your OS.

Software functionality is bundled in packages, and you can install the ones that are useful to you. A package handler makes it easy to update, install, and remove packages. There are several such package handlers, such as \verb!apt!, \verb!apt-get! and \verb!apt-cache!, but they are all very similar in usage.

Normally, you always update your OS before you install new software/packages. Try it out! Open a terminal by clicking on the Terminal icon in the upper left corner. It should look like in \figref{terminal}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{terminal.png}
    \caption{A terminal window}
    \label{fig:terminal}
\end{figure}

You update the OS by writing the command \eqref{eq:update} and pressing enter. The command tells the OS to download all available updates to your computer. Make sure that you are connected to the internet. You might get the question \texttt{Do you want to continue [Y/n]} if there is something to download. Type y or Y (short for yes) and press enter to continue, or n or N (short for no) to cancel.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:update}
\verb!sudo apt update!
\end{equation}
After the first command you always follow up by typing command \eqref{eq:upgrade}. This command tells the OS to actually install all the downloaded updates. Here you can also get the question if you want to continue, answer y in that case. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:upgrade}
\verb!sudo apt full-upgrade!
\end{equation}
Command \eqref{eq:clean} you can use if you have limited space and need to free up some more. Try it out!
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clean}
\verb!sudo apt clean!
\end{equation}
Sometimes you need to reboot your Pi in order for the changes to kick in. Try command \eqref{eq:reboot} or use the menu option (click on the raspberry in the top left corner of your screen) \emph{shutdown} to reboot.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reboot}
\verb!sudo reboot!
\end{equation}
%\newline
\verb!sudo! is short for \verb!super user do! and gives the current user root privileges. If you are using Windows maybe sometimes you get a pop-up windows saying that you need administrator privileges to continue, and you could say that root privileges is something similar in our OS. You often have to use \verb!sudo! when you are making permanent changes to your OS \cite{sudo}. The webcomic XKCD made a short comic \cite{xkcd} about the command that you can see in \figref{xkcd}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{sandwich.png}
    \caption{XKCDs comic\#149}
    \label{fig:xkcd}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\section{Task: write a shell script}
\noindent Shell scripts are good for automating tasks by running several commands consecutively, in a sequence. Your next task is now to write a shell script that runs all of commands \eqref{eq:update} to \eqref{eq:reboot} consecutively in a sequence for a full OS update cycle. You will need to find out exactly how to do this on your own, but a good indication that you are on the right track is that the instructions you find explains what a \textit{shebang} is, and probably also mention the \verb!chmod! command. Name your shell script file \verb!update_os.sh!, and make sure that it works by executing (running) it.

Using your new shell script knowledge, you can now both automate tasks and avoid retyping complicated commands.


\section{Lab Goal}
{\textcolor{red}{You will need to show the TAs that your Pi was properly installed, updated and can connect to Eduroam.}}

\section{Helpful Hints}

{\bf Hint 1: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To avoid rewriting many commands in the terminal, you can use the keys \texttt{arrow up} and \texttt{arrow down} to go back and forth between the commands that you just wrote.}\\
{\bf Hint 2: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To paste commands into the terminal you can use \texttt{Ctrl + Shift + V}}\\
{\bf Hint 3: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{Use \textit{Tab} to auto-complete the command in the terminal}\\
{\bf Hint 4: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To avoid rewriting many commands, it can be a good idea to write all steps in a batch file or shell script. Then you can also reuse the batch file for the second project.}

\section*{A last important note: Backup your data!}
It is strongly recommended that you backup your data on the SD card regularly. You will continously build on your previous work throughout the course so it is important you do not loose it. Device a backup strategy that suits you! Here are a couple of suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Git to store a copy of your work on GitHub or any other repository site in the cloud (as you learned in EDAB05 Programmering, Grundkurs). That way you can also easily move your work between the Raspberry and your other computers.
    \item Get yourself a USB memory stick (at least the size of your SD card -- 16/32 GB) and regularly copy the contents of your SD card onto it. There is a very nifty utility preinstalled on your Raspberry for this: SD Card Copier. You find it by clicking on the raspberry icon in the upper left of the screen and looking under ''Accessories''. If your SD card should crash you can simply remove the SD card, insert your USB backup stick into your Raspberry, and boot from the USB stick! 
\end{itemize}
\hline
